        <p>
          I am a Scrimba boot camp graduate. I am an aspiring front-end developer hoping to work on some projects and land a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.js. If the need calls for it, I can adapt and learn new skills, however. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My time at Scrimba has taught me not only how to program, but also has to think critically and logically.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am always looking for new projects to tackle, so feel free to contact me.
