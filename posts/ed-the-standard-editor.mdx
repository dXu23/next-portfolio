ed, commonly referred to as the standard editor, is a very early text
editor written for UNIX. It operates on lines instead of individual
characters. Vim, Emacs, and VS Code dominate the text editor market,
but ed still has a few niche usecases. It can be useful for scripting,
in environments without ncurses or termcap, or computers with very low
RAM. In this article, I will show a couple of tips on how to use ed.

To start ed, one can simply type "ed". Unlike vi and its descendants,
ed will give a warning if it is called on a non-existant file
name. Therefore, a file name should be given as an argument to ed only
if the file actually exists. Like vi/vim, though, ed is a modal
editor. ed by default starts in command mode. The "a" command will
cause ed to go into insertion mode and append text after the current
line, while the "i" command will likewise prepend text before the
current line. The "." command followed by a newline ends insertion
mode. The "w" command writes to a file, and "q" command quits ed. This
is probably best demonstrated as an example.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
$ ed
a
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) \{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
\}

.
w hello.c
85
q
$ ls
hello.c
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Of course, we can compile the C program:
<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
$ cc -o hello hello.c
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Unfortunately, the C program that was written, while not necessarily
incorrect, could be thought of as somewhat not cross-compatible. Let's
fix that.

To edit hello.c, we can type
<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
ed hello.c
</SyntaxHighlighter>

To print the current line, we can then type
<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
p

</SyntaxHighlighter>

It turns out that ed starts at the very last line. To go to the first
line, as well as print it, we can type

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
1p
#include <stdio.h>
</SyntaxHighlighter>

To copy a line at a certain point below another line, one can use
the t command. The following copies the line we are
currently on, and then pastes it below the current line.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
.t.
</SyntaxHighlighter>

If we want to change the current line, then we can use the substitute
command. This will feel very familiar to fans of *nix OSes who have
used sed before.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
s/io/lib/n
2       #include <stdlib.h>
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
/printf/s//puts/n
5       puts("Hello, world\n");
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Of course, the new line character is redundant since the puts function
outputs a new line after it prints a string to standard output, so we
can do away with it via the following command:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
s/\\n//p
    puts("Hello, world");
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Lastly, 0 is not necessarily the exit code that means success on all
operating systems. To make our C program as compatible as possible,
one merely has to type

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
/0/s//EXIT_SUCCESS/p
</SyntaxHighlighter>

To save and quit a file simultaneously, the "wq" command can be used:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
wq
112
</SyntaxHighlighter>

ed also has a delete command. Let's say that, for whatever reason, we
want to delete the inner contents of the main block. Then we can use
the d command:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
ed hello.c
112
?main?+1,?^}?-1d
?main?+1,.p
int main(void) \{
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

We end up on the closing brace of the main block by deleting its inner
contents. To undo a command, we can use the u command, which stands
for undo.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="plaintext">
u
?main?,.p
int main(void) \{
    puts("Hello, world!");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
\}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

There are a few more useful commands for the ed editor, but I think
that this is a good overview of some basic commands. Here are some
more resources on using the ed editor:
