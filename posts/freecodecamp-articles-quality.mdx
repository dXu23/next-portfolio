Let me just say this first: I really appreciate what freeCodeCamp
has done for the programming community. Many people's first introduction
to programming, in fact, was through freeCodeCamp. However, the quality
of their articles often leave something to be desired. 

For example, I recently read an article titled [How to Print Array Elements
in a Given Order With or Without a Function]
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-print-array-elements-in-given-order-with-and-without-function/).
I cringed when I saw the very first code snippet, which was this:
<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp">
  {`
    // Bad: 
    cout << "Enter the array size: ";
    int arraySize;
    cin >> arraySize;
    int arr[arraySize];
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

As explained in this article 
[Legitimate Use of Variable Length Arrays](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/10/27/),
variable length arrays (VLAs) are usually bad practice. Most of the time, it is
better to use std::vector instead:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="cpp">
  {`
    // Good: 
    cout << "Enter the array size: ";
    int arraySize;
    cin >> arraySize;
    vector<int> arr(arraySize, 0);
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

The other gripes that I have with the article is that it doesn't mention
for-each loops, which are present in most other C-based languages except C
itself and the use of std::endl when '\n' is usually better. See 
[Don't Use std::endl](https://accu.org/journals/overload/27/149/sharpe_2619/).

This is not the only freeCodeCamp article that I have problems with, of course.
About a couple of weeks ago, I read an article titled
[How to Build Your Own Blog with Next.js and MDX](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-your-own-blog-with-next-js-and-mdx/).
I was originally going to use the article to help me build this blog, but I found
that I couldn't since the errors present in the article made it impossible. The
code snippets sometimes conflicted logically with each other. For example, the
function getAllArticles seems alright at first:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    export async function getAllArticles() {
      const articles = fs.readdirSync(path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles'))

      return articles.reduce((allArticles, articleSlug) => {
        // get parsed data from mdx files in the "articles" dir
        const source = fs.readFileSync(
          path.join(process.cwd(), 'data/articles', articleSlug),
          'utf-8'
        )
        const { data } = matter(source)

        return [
          {
            ...data, // pay attention to this line here
            slug: articleSlug.replace('.mdx', ''),
            readingTime: readingTime(source).text,
          },
          ...allArticles,
        ]
      }, [])
    }

  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

The function appears to be returning an array of article objects, with each
article having the fields slug, readingTime, and the fields present in data.
If we take a look at getStaticProps, however...

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    import { getAllArticles } from '../../src/utils/mdx'

    export async function getStaticProps() {
      const articles = await getAllArticles()

      articles
        .map((article) => article.data) // original article object contains nested data fields ?!
        .sort((a, b) => {
          if (a.data.publishedAt > b.data.publishedAt) return 1
          if (a.data.publishedAt < b.data.publishedAt) return -1

          return 0
        })

      return {
        props: {
          posts: articles.reverse(),
        },
      }
    }

  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

It should be the case that the article objects present in the array
returned by getAllArticles do not have a data field; instead, the
article objects should contain the fields present in the *data* object.
However, the code in getStaticProps references data; while there is the
possibility that the data object present in the return value of matter
also contains a data field, that field would have to contain ANOTHER
data field, which is pretty unlikely.

Worse still, the method chain consisting of map and sort in getStaticProps
does not even appear to be doing anything meaningful. The Array.prototype.map
method in Javascript
[creates a new array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map),
and Array.prototype.sort
[sorts the elements of an array in place](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort).
So the articles array returned by getAllArticles **never even changes**. 

I think the takeaway here is that freeCodeCamp articles are sometimes substandard,
so programmers should take caution when reading their articles. While I'm aware that
there is an [editorial process](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/)
that freeCodeCamp uses, I would appreciate it if they checked whether the code present in
their tutorials/articles actually works and is idiomatic.
