# Next Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website built with Next.js. I never made
it with the intention of anybody reusing it, but if anyone is
interested, run:

```
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

to get a preview of the website, and

```
pnpm run dev
```

for development. This portfolio is 90% finished, I'd say, but
if possible, I'd probably make the following adjustments:
 - [ ] Better-looking React Icons for source and project link. Current ones are too blocky.
 - [ ] Mobile support. Probably should've done responsive design from the beginning, but
   I forgot. Don't think that most recruiters would be looking at portfolio sites on their
   phone though.
